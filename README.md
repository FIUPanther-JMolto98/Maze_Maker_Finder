<b>ðŸŸ¨This is our final project for Florida International University CAP4630/5602 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course:ðŸŸ¦</b> 

Our program consists of an interactive game in which the user is given a window containing a white, gridded screen representing a blank m x m (square) matrix. Within the game, the player will then be able to interact with the screen and draw black squares representing the obstacles of the maze, as well as designate which coordinate of the matrix to be the starting point [Si,Sj] and the end point [Gi,Gj] using the cursor and a very intuitive UI. Once the maze has been drawn and the starting and end points specified, the user can select which pathfinding algorithm to use in order to solve the maze (DFS, BFS, GBF, DIJ, AST). Our program will be written in the Python programming language to take advantage of libraries such as PyGame for the GUI and PyTest for testing and debugging purposes.
